					When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would
					shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party
					of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in
					Hobbiton.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder
					of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable
					disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had brought
					back from his travels had now become a local legend, and it was
					popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say, that the
					Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure. And
					if that was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged
					vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have little
					effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at
					fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved, but
					unchanged would have been nearer the mark. There were some that
					shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing;
					it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently)
					perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.
				</p>
				<p>
					"It will have to be paid for," they said. "It isn"t natural, and
					trouble will come of it!" But so far trouble had not come; and
					as Mr. Baggins was generous with his money, most people were
					willing to forgive him his oddities and his good fortune. He
					remained on visiting terms with his relatives (except, of
					course, the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted
					admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families. But
					he had no close friends, until some of his younger cousins began
					to grow up.
